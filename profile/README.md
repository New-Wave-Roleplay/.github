# New Wave Roleplay Repository

## Access and Usage Policy
Access to this repository is granted **exclusively to developers actively working on the New Wave Roleplay project**. If a developer leaves the community or ceases active participation, they will be required to delete any assets obtained from this repository. All assets and resources belong to the New Wave Roleplay community and are to be treated as such.

## Confidentiality
All content within this repository is **confidential**. Any breaches of data or unauthorized sharing of repository content will result in immediate removal and banning from the project.

## Lead Developers
The lead developers for this project are:
- **Mark (ItsMeerken)**
- **Jay (Jayw89)**

All queries and concerns regarding development or processes must be directed to either Mark or Jay.

## Queries and Assistance
If you have any questions or encounter issues with any processes, it is crucial to notify the lead developers **as soon as possible**. Early communication allows us to address concerns effectively and provide better assistance.

## Repository Workflow and Security
This repository is utilized as a **secure method** for managing and deploying server files. By using this system, we can:
- **Track changes**: Maintain a detailed history of all modifications, making it easier to identify and resolve issues when something goes wrong.
- **Avoid data loss**: Unlike FileZilla, which overwrites files without retaining previous versions, this repository allows us to re-trace steps and recover files if needed.

To ensure the security and integrity of the project, all developers must adhere to this workflow. Unauthorized methods of file transfer, such as direct use of FileZilla, are prohibited.
